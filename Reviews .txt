                <p>"Chris and Jake did such a fab job of fitting our new log burner. They removed the old gas fire with false breast, built a brand new chimney breast, and fitted in our new log burner. They were professional and worked super hard all week even in the snow! Would definitely recommend to anyone!" - Stacey Butler</p>

            <div class="slide">
                <p>"Absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, I had used another company previously, and my log burner was not fitted right, which meant it was unsafe and not working correctly. I then called Apollo Heatsource as they were recommended to me. Chris is very good at his job, fair priced, clean, professional, and genuinely a nice guy. Nothing is too much trouble for him." - Greg Chambers</p>

                <p>"Chris came and looked at fitting us two new stoves in our cafe-to-be. He is friendly, knowledgeable, thoroughly professional, and gave us a very competitive quote. We are extremely pleased with his work—he’s done a great job from start to finish. He is efficient, very clean, and tidy. The stoves look handsome and add real ambiance to both rooms." - Richard Needham</p>
