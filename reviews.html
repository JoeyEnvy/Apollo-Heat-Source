                        <p>When I decided I wanted a log burner installed in my new home, I knew exactly who to call! Chris had fitted a stove in my previous home seven years ago, and it's still going strong. Chris is reliable, knowledgeable, honest, punctual, and tidy. I highly recommend him to anyone. I can't wait to use the log burner this winter—exceptional, top-tier service from Apollo Heat Source. Thanks again, it looks amazing!</p>

                        <p>"Chris and Co did a wonderful job! Very professional at all times, kept us informed about what was happening, and even tolerated a very curious border collie! They were just great! Showed us how to control the fire when lit, explained how to start it going—everything we needed to know. So we are sorted for winter! Thank you so much for getting this sorted out for us. Really appreciate it."</p>
