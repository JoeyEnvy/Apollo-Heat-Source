            <p>"Chris and Jake did such a fab job of fitting our new log burner. They removed the old gas fire with false breast, built a brand new chimney breast, and fitted in our new log burner. This included twin wall flue, tiling, beam with lights, and slate hearth. They were professional and worked super hard all week even in the snow! Would definitely recommend to anyone!" - Stacey Butler</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p>"Absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, I had used another company previously, and my log burner was not fitted right, which meant it was unsafe and not working correctly. I then called Apollo Heatsource as they were recommended to me by someone else. Chris is very good at his job, fair priced, clean, professional, and genuinely a nice guy. Nothing is too much trouble for him. I'd 100% recommend this company, and personally, I would not go anywhere else but to Apollo Heatsource." - Greg Chambers</p>

        <div class="slide">
            <p>"Chris came and looked at fitting us two new stoves in our cafe-to-be. Having read other excellent reviews of his work, I was keen to engage him to do ours. He is friendly, knowledgeable, thoroughly professional, and gave us a very competitive quote. We are extremely pleased with his work—he's done a great job from start to finish. He is efficient, very clean, and tidy. The stoves look handsome and add real ambiance to both rooms. A great big thank you! Apollo Heatsource, I have no hesitation in recommending you." - Richard Needham</p>

            <p>"Chris and Co did a wonderful job! Very professional at all times, kept us informed about what was happening, and even tolerated a very curious border collie! They were just great! Showed us how to control the fire when lit, explained how to start it going—everything we needed to know. So we are sorted for winter! Thank you so much for getting this sorted out for us. Really appreciate it." - Sarah Hughes</p>

            <p>"We recently had our open fire converted into a multifuel stove. Thoroughly professional throughout and was able to do this at a safe social distance. Would highly recommend for quality, efficiency, and all at a fair cost. Thanks again!" - Emma Longfellow</p>

        <p>"Chris and his helper did an amazing job at fitting the log burner. I had a geo beam, nice brick tiles in the chamber with a black slate hearth, and a classic 8 eco fire. I was expecting it to be good, but everything, especially the hearth, is amazing. Real good quality, great attention to detail. I highly recommend these guys. Thanks, Chris."</p>
